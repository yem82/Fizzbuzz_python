Fizzbuzz (Python)
--------------------------------------------

A TDD approach to Fizzbuzz using unittest

to run the program open up the console and run 'python fizzbuzz.py'.

You should be able to see a list of numbers from 1 to 100 with numbers divisible by 3 substituted with 'buzz', divisible by 5, 'Fizz' and divisble by 15, 'Fizzbuzz'.

To run the test type 'python -m unittest test_fizzbuzz' in the console.
